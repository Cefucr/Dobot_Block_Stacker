# Dobot_Block_Stacker
Made with <a href="https://github.com/Unn0o">@Unn0o</a>.<br>
This python code uses the DoBot Magician arm to stack 3 blocks and 
after that randomizes their position and does the same thing over and over.

The code uses a webcam to see the blocks which is mounted on the DoBot Arm.
